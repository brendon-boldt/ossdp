If there are two things that people will spurn computer scientists on, it is for being socially inept and uncreative. While the former is beyond the scope of music (well, not entirely), the latter is certainly not. My two current instruments are flute and piano, though in the (deep, dark) past I have played oboe. Additionally, I hone my creativity via improvisation and composition for these two instruments. While I could go on about <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=benefits+of+music&oq=benefits+of+music&aqs=chrome..69i57.2527j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8' target='_blank'>the benefits of music</a>, I will let the million and one articles explain it for me; but music has taught me one thing that I seek to find in every hobby, field of study, or task I embark on: creativity of expression.

Most people quickly find that I am an enigma in both my words and my behavior, and I accordingly turn to music as an alternative way to communicate (but this seldom works). Nevertheless, from my wild improvisations to my somber, minimalistic compositions, I weave music as personal and mental exercise. A proper solution to a problem in mathematics or programming is often simple and beautiful and music is no different--even when things seem to be complex and dissonant, their constituent parts can each exhibit a simplicity and beauty of their own. Two composers which have had the most impact on this view of mine are Steve Reich and Philip Glass with their minimalist styles--something I find great beauty in. Thus I take this love of simplicity and beauty and seek to apply it not only in the music I create, but in every aspect of my life.
