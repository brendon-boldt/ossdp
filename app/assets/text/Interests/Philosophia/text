Literally “the love of wisdom”, philosophy has been a topic area that interests me in contrast to my intense love for all things computer science; in fact, I often catch people off guard when I mention that I am a computer science _and_ philosophy major because, to them, there just is not a lot in common between the two--they are completely wrong. I could go on for pages about the correlations between Plato’s Theory of Forms and its implementation of the object-oriented paradigm or the possibility of free will in strong artificial intelligence with respect to compatibilist and incompatibilist interpretations of the meaning of “free will”, but that is for another article. Though I did not take a philosophy class _per se_ until my freshman year of college, I always had an implicit interest in philosophy due to my fascination with logic, classical literature, and theology which had been nurtured by the classical education I received in high school.

## Logic

The fact that I like logic is not terribly surprising considering that I similarly like computer programming, mathematics, and the hard sciences (sorry sociology), but the use of logic in philosophy has quite a different spin than it does in the more left-brained disciplines. Logic in the context of programming and math is very rigid and mechanical because the topics themselves are rigid and mechanical, but in the context of philosophy (save for symbolic logic), logic is applied to a more amorphous set ideas. This makes logic both messy and beautiful in ways that it cannot be in math and science.

## Classical Literature

While reading has not always been my forte, I have always enjoyed and valued reading classical literature. Though my first experience in such literature occurred through translating the _Aeneid_ from the original Latin, my first true encounter happened my junior year of high school through the reading of Homer’s _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. My teacher not only spoke of the symbolism relevant to each work, but of the symbolism relative to other works of classical literature, philosophical ideas, and even to each of us as an individual. It was then that I learned that philosophical images present themselves in powerful ways outside the standard repertoire of philosophical texts.

## Theology

Finally, I found philosophy to be a wonderful companion to the theology I had learned and practiced in my Catholic upbringing. While to some, philosophy and religion may seem to be at odds, I have never found a conflict between two. I looked to writers such as Pascal, Aquinas, Augustine, and Boethius to demonstrate how theology and philosophy can play an integral and intertwined role in explaining the truths of the world.
